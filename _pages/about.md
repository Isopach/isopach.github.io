Hello world, I am Isopach.    

I do Web/Misc/Forensics in [CTF.SG](https://ctftime.org/team/77768), a Singaporean team.     
I used to play for OpenToAll between 2018-2020, and still play with them sometimes.     

This is a blog for my CTF Writeups, because people have been telling me that it's hard to read a github `.md` file lol.

Anyway, if you wanna know more, feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kohyouliang), or see my resume [here](https://resume.ylkoh.top)!

Also, you can contact me anytime at my email on the link in the footer.

Interested in the theme, or want to read/link to the `.md` files directly? You can find this repository's source on [Github](https://github.com/Isopach/isopach.github.io).

Shamelessly plugging my wishlist here:
