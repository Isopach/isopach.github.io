Hello world, I am Isopach.    

I do Web/Misc/Forensics in CTF.SG, a Singapore team.     
I used to play for OpenToAll between 2018-2020, and still play with them sometimes.     

This is a blog for my CTF Writeups, because people have been telling me that it's hard to read a github `.md` file lol.

Anyway, if you wanna know more, feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kohyouliang), or see my resume [here](https://resume.ylkoh.top)!
