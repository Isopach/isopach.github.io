### Introduction

Synthesia is a popular piano software that helps users to learn via positioning of the piano keys instead of the traditional music sheets. 

There are many parts of the application that takes user input, and it does not require privileged access to run. Hence, a non-privileged user e.g. Guest User can also run this application and use this bug to crash it, which causes denial of service at the very least. It might be possible to escalate it further, but I did not find a way. 

### Bug Discovery 

This is redacted.

### The Exploit

This is also redacted.

### Afterthoughts

As I have started my own consultancy while also working at my full-time job, I find that I have less and less time to write blog posts. That said, I am still doing security research every day and working on my OSEP with the Try Harder attitude. Anyway, an advisory page is in the works, but for now please bear with the redacted sections.
