title: TISC 2021 Writeup
published: true
categories: [Misc]
excerpt: Very short TISC writeup as I only did up to level 2 out of 10. The lower levels were all steganography challenges which discouraged me from continuing. Writeup for level 2 may be added at a later date, but it is basically a DNS exfiltration challenge where you have to decode something in the subdomains to get the flag.
