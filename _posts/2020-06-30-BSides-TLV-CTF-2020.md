excerpt: I participated with CTF.SG again, but as most of us were burnt out from 0ctf, we didn't have the full force this time around. The site uses fixed scoring and not dynamic, so some questions were determined to be easier than others.

  Dumbster diving.

The challenge description mentions Dumpster, which means Garbage Bin - thus we check the Recycle Bin.
When I first opened it, I saw many recycled `phrases`, like over 1000 files maybe, so I knew it was the right place.
As we are searching for something that stands out, let's sort by file type to filter out all these `phrases`.

Upon doing so, I found a very obvious `BSIDESTLV2020.txt`, which I opened and there was the flag!

  You need some EFF in your life.

From what I can tell, EFF refers to Electronic Frontier Foundation, which doesn't mean anything for us.

So what can be better with less, in a computer context? Maybe your browsing history?

Hence I went to check for browser history! First IE... nope nothing there.

So I continued looking for something that stood out... this time it was Chrome History!

Unfortunately I deleted the 8 GB image so I don't have a screenshot now.

And we've found the flag!
