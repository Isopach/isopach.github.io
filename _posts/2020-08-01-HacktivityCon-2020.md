I played guess the flag with CTF.SG last week, spending a total of 3 hours to solve 20+/- of all the guess challenges. We only had a few people playing, so it wasn't surprising that we finished around top 40.

This is obviously referring to Mayo, the well-known hacker who earned over a million USD on hackerone.

Did you know that 78% of hackers used their hacking experience to help them find or better compete for a career opportunity?
</details>

This is referring to one of the yearly reports. You'll know from the title.

HackerOne.com/????????


</details>

I was the 4th solver for this. Changelog obviously refers to the policy changelog, and the question was simply which program it was. Given that this is HackerOne's official ctf, I deduced that the link was referring to `Hackerone/security`, and there was the flag.

You can see it for yourself: https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?type=team&change=3640655

As someone who used to run a bug bounty in my previous company, I concur with the flag.

How do you write a video? 

The answer is of course, in the transcript. You'll find the flag in the [HackerOne video of the same name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cDj2-1_zo).

Just go to `config.yml` in HackerOne's official github repo.

Not sure why it refers to `#35` because I found it on `#50` though.
