I played guess the flag with CTF.SG last week, spending a total of 3 hours to solve 20+/- of all the guess challenges. We only had a few people playing, so it wasn't surprising that we finished around top 40.

Have you seen the million dollar jar of mayo on HackerOne?

</details>

This is obviously referring to Mayo, the well-known hacker who earned over a million USD on hackerone.

I was the 4th solver for this. Changelog obviously refers to the policy changelog, and the question was simply which program it was. Given that this is HackerOne's official ctf, I deduced that the link was referring to `Hackerone/security`, and there was the flag.

You can see for it yourself: https://hackerone.com/security/policy_versions?type=team&change=3640655

As someone who used to run a bug bounty in my previous company, I concur with the flag.
