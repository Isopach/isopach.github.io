I"-<p>Hello world, I am Isopach.  <br />
I do Web/Misc/Forensics in CTF.SG, a Singapore team.   <br />
I used to play for OpenToAll between 2018-2020, and still play with them sometimes.</p>

<p>This is a blog for my CTF Writeups, because people have been telling me that itâ€™s hard to read a github <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> file lol.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you wanna know more, feel free to follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kohyouliang">Twitter</a>, or see my resume <a href="https://resume.ylkoh.top">here</a>!</p>
